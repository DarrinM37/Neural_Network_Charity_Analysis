# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Purpose

A foundation wants to predict on which investments would make the best return. The goal is to use machine learning and neural networks to apply features on a provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the foundation. The initial file has 34,000 organizations and a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization from past successful fundings.

# Results

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
Checking to see if the target is marked as successful in the DataFrame, indicating that it has been successfully funded by AlphabetSoup.

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The IS_SUCCESSFUL column is the feature chosen for this dataset.

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The EIN and NAME columns will not increase the accuracy of the model and can be removed to improve code efficiency.

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
